                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>I've been working mostly in the back end for ~2 years but over the last two months or so I started a bit more front end stuff in AnuglarJS at work. This is primarily b/c our front-end programmer left. However, it's not a ton of new development, mostly maintenance and adding like a new button here or there (I'm still learning AngularJS) and then adding the functionality to the back end as usual.</p>

Because of this website, we were able to increase awareness as the servers response time is 5x times faster than the shared hosting plan I had before. Very powerful platform and it really got my message out.Very easy to create your website, so much pleasure to use it afterwards! The best feature is the way all templates are built. It is easy to choose from the array of templates to make your own look, but even if you are not a pro, it will look professionalLegit the best thing I've done. So far this journey has been a breeze because of SITE123. The customer service is AMAZING. Nothing they can't do for you. Just ask. I am looking forward to the rest of my progress with ”</p></div>
